# typescript-to-kotlin
Convert Typescript definitions to Kotlin external declarations

### Motivation/Goals
This project is meant to be a stopgap solution to translating Typescript definitions to Kotlin. Currently, the kotlin dukat project fails to create any output in many situations. The aim of this project is to always generate some output that even if not perfect should save you time when translating Typescript definitions to Kotlin.
